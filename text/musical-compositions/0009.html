<p>In "Pluto", I wanted to portray the vast distance and darkness of this dwarf planet, as well as its freezing cold atmosphere. Although technically not a planet, the stark beauty of Pluto compelled me to write a piece for it. My inspiration was a photo recently taken by New Horizons, which can be found <a href="www.nasa.gov/sites/default/fileâ€¦-17-15-final_0.png" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>"Pluto" is the last of a work-in-progress suite of solo cello pieces called The Spheres. The suite draws inspiration from the physical environment of each planet, rather than from mythological sources. Each planet is depicted in a highly structured manner with clearly defined sections, each of which evoke a certain feeling, mood, or atmosphere.</p>
