<p><em>Battle of the Trees</em> explores the primal qualities of the voice, using only two solo vocalists. The piece tells a story about life, transformation, and death. A tree is brought to life by a sorceress to lead her army. A great battle ensues, during which the tree is mortally wounded. The tree recounts his transformations as he returns back to nature, until finally, he is at peace. The text is derived from the ancient Welsh poem "Kat Godeu" ("The Battle of the Trees") in <em>Llyfr Taliesin</em> ("The Book of Taliesin"), translated by W. F. Skene (1809-1892). The following is an excerpt from that poem:</p>
<blockquote>
    When the trees were enchanted,<br />
    The trees uttered their voices<br />
    From strings of harmony,<br />
    <br />
    I was enchanted by the sage<br />
    Of sages, in the ancient world.<br />
    I played in the twilight,<br />
    I slept in purple;<br />
    I was truly in the enchantment<br />
    <br />
    The strong-handed gleamer, his name,<br />
    With a gleam he rules his numbers.<br />
    They would spread out in a flame,<br />
    And a battle was contested<br />
    Under the root of his tongue;<br />
    Thither hastened grass and trees<br />
    A very wrathful wood,<br />
    The mountain has become crooked,<br />
    The woods have become a kiln,<br />
    <br />
    And transformed us, and changed our faded state.<br />
    I have been a sword,<br />
    I have been a tear in the air,<br />
    I have been the dullest of stars.<br />
    I have been a word among letters,<br />
    I have been a book in the origin.<br />
    I have been the light of lanterns,<br />
    I have been an eagle.<br />
    I have been a drop in a shower;<br />
    I have been a sword<br />
    I have been a shield in battle.<br />
    I have been a string in a harp,<br />
    in water, in foam.<br />
    A golden gem in a golden jewel.<br />
    I am splendid<br />
    And shall be wanton
