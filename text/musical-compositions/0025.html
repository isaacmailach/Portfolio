<blockquote><em>ShadowLight</em> is an interactive, immersive and multimedia experience inside of an exact replica of a World War II cattle car that was used to transport Jews and other targeted groups to the concentration camps and extermination camps. Visitors will be able to emotionally connect to the displays as well as the experience through being immersed in this historical space.<br><br>
The infamous Holocaust cattle car was used to forcibly deport Jews and other targeted groups to the concentration camps, labour camps and extermination camps throughout Europe between the years of 1941-1944. This was a wooden freight car meant to transport cattle. Up to 150 individuals were crammed into locked, windowless box cars and travelled for an average of 4 days in this state without food water, restroom facilities or even the ability to sit down. Many deportees died in the cattle cars enroute and for the others, it symbolized the terrifying descent into the darkness that robbed them of their families, freedom and for some, even their lives.<br><br>
Historians suggest that without the mass transportation carried out on the railways in these box cars, the scale of the Final Solution would not have been possible.</blockquote>
