<p><em>When Woods Fail</em> was inspired by the following poem, written by J.R.R. Tolkien:</p>
<blockquote>
    O! Wanderers in the shadowed land<br />
    despair not! For though dark they stand,<br />
    all woods there be must end at last,<br />
    and see the open sun go past:<br />
    the setting sun, the rising sun,<br />
    the day's end, or the day begun.<br />
    For east or west all woods must fail...
</blockquote>
