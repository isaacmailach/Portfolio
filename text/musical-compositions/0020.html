The film is divided into several sections that focus on specific ingredients. Each section has a distinct sound and features different solo instruments, such as guitar, cello, marimba, and vibraphone. The above excerpts correspond to the ingredients sunflower (piano), tomato (marimba), and honey (flute). The final excerpt is taken from the ending of the documentary.</p>
<blockquote>Before the Plate follows each ingredient from a single plate of food backwards to the farms they came from, revealing modern farming practices and the challenges the industry faces as it does so.</blockquote>
