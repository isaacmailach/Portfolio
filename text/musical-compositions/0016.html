<p>"Mercury", the closest planet to our Sun. This piece depicts this extremely hot and rocky planet through high energy rhythms, dissonance, and dynamics.</p>
<p>"Mercury" is the first of a work-in-progress suite of solo cello pieces called The Spheres. The suite draws inspiration from the physical environment of each planet, rather than from mythological sources. Each planet is depicted in a highly structured manner with clearly defined sections, each of which evoke a certain feeling, mood, or atmosphere.</p>
