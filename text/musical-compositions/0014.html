<p>A continuation of my previous work, "Entering Timirith", "Timirith Falls" takes a more solemn view of the futuristic city named Timirith. The work is part of a tone poem titled <em>Tridecum</em> that tells an original story about a tragedy that takes place in a futuristic fictional world. In this scene, our character contemplates his actions and begins to question whether his urge for revenge may harm others along the way.</p>
