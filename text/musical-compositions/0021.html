<p>The concept behind this project was first conceived two years ago. My goal was to create an introspective work that explored sound without the confines of narrative. While composing the work, I was striving to achieve a balance between the intellectual and creative parts of my mind, i.e. the rational and irrational. I wanted to create a work that is both emotionally challenging and intellectually stimulating, while having layers of meaning that the listener can uncover over repeated listenings. It took many unsuccessful attempts and drafts before I arrived at the final product.</p>
<p>The instrumentation of the work is solo cello accompanied by string orchestra. The unique blend or clash of timbres that a string orchestra can produce provided ample opportunities for subtle distinctions between the cello soloist and the orchestra. I received inspiration for the tone of the work from the music of Morton Feldman and Igor Stravinsky. Morton Feldman had a remarkable ability to take a simple idea and, using repetition, extrapolate an entire composition with extreme craftsmanship. Feldman and Stravinsky were also experts at sound colour, sometimes treating colour with the same amount of significance as melody. I tried to express both of these concepts through Cello Concerto.</p>
<p>The concerto is divided into 4 movements, with the last two being played <i>attacca</i>, without a break. While the movements are quite distinct in terms of style and sound, they are all associated in one way or another primarily through motive. The first movement introduces many of the ideas that are developed later in the work, most notably the use of repetition. For the second movement, the cello soloist plays alone, grasping at various thoughts until arriving at something unexpected. The third movement uses primarily three pitch classes, first introduced in the second movement, and develops those pitches texturally. The fourth movement explores shifting colours of sound while the isolated cello sits motionless atop the sound of the orchestra.</p>
